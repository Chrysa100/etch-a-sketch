# etch-a-sketch
Practice and explore HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation with this project.
What I got occupied with during this project:
- Flexbox
- DOM  manipulation
- Event listeners
- Styling/ CSS
- Default values of parameters in functions

- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.
- You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used.
- (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
